# Inaugural project

**Overview:**

This project explores an exchange economy model featuring two consumers, A and B, and two goods. Through eight questions, we investigate utility maximization, resource allocation, and pricing mechanisms under different market scenarios.

The findings are presented within the `inauguralproject.ipynb` notebook. The main code is in the `inauguralproject.py` file, where we define the `ExchangeEconomyClass` to model the economy's dynamics. The project is designed to run with a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation without the need for additional packages.
