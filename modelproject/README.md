# Model analysis project

The project, titled **Black-Scholes Model Analysis**, delves into the pricing of options. It begins by exploring the analytical solution provided by the Black-Scholes model, then transitions to a numerical approach using the binomial tree method. As an extension for further research, the analysis looks at American options.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
